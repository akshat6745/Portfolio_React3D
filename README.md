# Portfolio_React3D
This site uses React to create a dynamic front-end website. It uses React frameworks like React-three and framer motion to give functionality and dynamic components. We use Tailwind-CSS for CSS. This helps us to save time as we can just use a lot of ready made classes to make our website beatiful and responsive.
I deployed this website using netlify
